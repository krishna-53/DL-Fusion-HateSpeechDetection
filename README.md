# Hate Speech Detection using Deep Learning Fusion Approach

This project focuses on detecting hate speech in Twitter posts using a combination of deep learning models and pretrained embeddings. A fusion strategy is applied to enhance prediction performance by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: SemEval Task 5
- **Type**: Twitter tweets
- **Task**: Binary classification – Hate Speech vs Non-Hate Speech

## 📌 Approach

The project combines multiple models with different embedding strategies for improved detection:

### 🔧 Models & Embeddings Used

- **Logistic Regression** with Word2Vec
- **CNN** with Word2Vec
- **LSTM** with Word2Vec
- **SVM** with BERT sentence embeddings
- **ANN** with ELMo embeddings

### 🔀 Fusion Strategy

- Final predictions are generated by fusing:
  - **CNN + SVM (BERT) + ANN (ELMo)**
  - Using **mean** and **max** fusion methods on predicted probabilities

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- HuggingFace Transformers (for BERT)
- TensorFlow Hub (for ELMo)
- Gensim (for Word2Vec)
